# Pirating-guide
This repository is here as a guide to all the newbie in the world of game piracy, here I will give you guys basic sources which will be useful for you to find the game you are looking for and stop sticking to a single website for pirated games. Note:- all the websites stated are verified by me and you should not worry about them having virus.

# What is game piracy
Well its basically people having games in their device for free of cost let us assume you want to play "x" game but that game("x") costs 57$ to download and play, So we basically look upto help from other people just to get the "x" game for free of cost from them and enjoy its gameplay.(Simple defination of game piracy)

# What is torrent
They are just a way to download larger file from smaller file using "Peer to Peer"(P2P) network, their extension is .torrent and we cant install it without any proper application present in the device for it.
So, you may ask what application are you talking about? well the answer is to download torrent files we need application like "Qbittorrent" and many more... i cant say which is best for downloading but i personally use qbittorrent
Make sure to use vpn when downloading files from those application to protect your identity.

# Where to find those torrent files
well the answer is simple you may find the files from websites some of the websites are fitgirl,dodi and many more but for starting and downloading basic games you only need fitgirl and if you cant find it in fitgirl then dodi will be usefull, And... if not both then search up for the game in reddit subreddits like r/piracy and many more
